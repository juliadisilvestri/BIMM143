# Class 16 Lab

# Using RStudio to read data output

First, I need to read in my tsv file that I obtained earlier in the class:

```{r}
data <- read.table("mm-second.x.zebrafish.tsv", col.names = c("qseqid", "sseqid", "pident", "length", "mismatch", "gapopen", "qstart", "qend", "sstart", "send", "evalue", "bitscore"))

head(data)
```

Make a histogram of the bitscore values:

```{r}
hist(data$bitscore, breaks = 30, main = "Bitscore Values from Zebrafish",xlab = "Bitscore")
```

Now we will plot percent identity against bitscore to see the relationship between them using ggplot:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data, aes(pident, bitscore)) + geom_point(alpha=0.1) 
```

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes((data$pident * (data$qend - data$qstart)), bitscore)) + geom_point(alpha=0.1) + geom_smooth()


```
